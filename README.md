# FTP Connection and File Transfer in Windows Kernel Driver

üîåüìÅ This project includes a command to establish an FTP connection and send files in a Windows kernel driver development environment. The project communicates over Windows Sockets (Winsock) using the libwsk library.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio development environment
- libwsk library

## Installation

1. Clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CaptanMoss/kernel_ftp.git
    ```

2. Open the project with Visual Studio.

3. Add the libwsk library to your project and configure it if necessary.

4. Build your project.

## Usage

1. Install the compiled driver on your system.

2. Run the command to establish an FTP connection and send files:

    ```bash
    ftp.exe ftp.server.com 21
    ```

## Example Code

```c
#include <ntddk.h>
#include <wsk.h>

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(_In_ DRIVER_OBJECT* DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath)
{
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegistryPath);

    NTSTATUS Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;

    do
    {
        ExInitializeDriverRuntime(DrvRtPoolNxOptIn);
        DriverObject->DriverUnload = DriverUnload;

        WSKDATA WSKData = { 0 };
        Status = WSKStartup(MAKE_WSK_VERSION(1, 0), &WSKData);
        if (!NT_SUCCESS(Status))
        {
            break;
        }

        Status = StartWSKClient(IP_ADDRESS,
            TCP_PORT,
            AF_INET,
            SOCK_STREAM);
        if (!NT_SUCCESS(Status))
        {
            break;
        }

    } while (FALSE);

    if (!NT_SUCCESS(Status))
    {
        DriverUnload(DriverObject);
    }

    return Status;
}

```
